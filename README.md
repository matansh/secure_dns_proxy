Welcome to Matan Shalit's TLS DNS proxy implementation

### Server options:
#### `open_source_server.py`
If this task would be given to me as part of my development tasks I would not opt to implement everything from scratch.

Instead I would utilized open-sourced solutions in order to minimize development effort. 

This implementation represents how i would deliver this task without the requirement to develop my own solution from scratch.

#### `self_implmented_server.py`
